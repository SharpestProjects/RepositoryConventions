# SharpestMinds Mentorship Projects

Welcome! This README describes our repository & project conventions for general structuring.

1. Naming: Repository names should be in [PascalCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) (basically just camel case but the first letter is also capitalized). Try to use something descriptive and catchy for your project!
2. Descriptions: Make sure you provide a friendly 1-2 sentence description of your project under its title when viewing the repository. If you have a deployment website, provide it under the website section also!
3. README: Create a README file that goes more in depth about your project. If you need some inspiration, check out [TensorFlow's README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/README.md)! Images, links, GIFs, build instructions and "getting started" sections are perfect. The following qualities should be obvious to whomever may view your repository:
	- Objective (What are you trying to solve?)
	- Solution
	- Dependencies
	- Results (Visualizations/Data)
